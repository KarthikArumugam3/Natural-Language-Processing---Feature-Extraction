# Natural-Language-Processing-Feature-Extraction

In this repository I have demonstrated how Feature Extraction is performed for raw string/text data.

1. In the first notebook -"Feature Extraction from Text - Coding Count Vectorization Manually" i have shown how to read in a text file containing raw text samples and how to manually create the Baf=g of words model containing Count Vectorization of those words manually.

2. In the second notebook - "Feature Extraction from Text - Scikit-learn" I have demonstarted how using Scikit-learn we can perform Count Vectorization and also the TF-IDF Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency to get the term frequency values for each of the words in the documents.

The Scikit-learn API's I have used are 
1. CountVectorizer
2. TfidfTransformer
3. TfidfVectorizer
